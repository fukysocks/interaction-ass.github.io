      <p> History of Tea:
Tea has a rich and ancient history that dates back thousands of years, originating in China. Legend has it that in 2737 BC, Emperor Shen Nong discovered tea when tea leaves blew into his pot of boiling water. Tea quickly became popular for its refreshing taste and invigorating properties. It spread to other parts of Asia, including Japan and India, where it became an integral part of their cultures.
Tea was introduced to the West in the 16th century by traders and explorers. Its popularity grew rapidly, becoming a staple beverage in many countries around the world.</p>

<p>Types of Tea:</p>

<p>Green Tea: Green tea is made from unoxidized tea leaves and is known for its fresh, grassy flavor. To make green tea, freshly picked tea leaves are quickly steamed or pan-fired to prevent oxidation. This preserves the natural green color and delicate flavor of the leaves.</p>

<p>Black Tea: Black tea is made from fully oxidized tea leaves and is known for its robust flavor and dark color. The process of making black tea involves withering the leaves, rolling them to release their natural juices, and then allowing them to oxidize fully before drying. This oxidation process gives black tea its characteristic flavor and color.</p>

<p>Fruit Tea: Fruit tea, also known as herbal tea or tisane, is made from dried fruits, flowers, herbs, or spices. Unlike traditional tea made from the Camellia sinensis plant, fruit tea does not contain any tea leaves and is caffeine-free. Fruit teas come in a variety of flavors, including berry, citrus, and tropical fruits, and can be enjoyed hot or cold.</p>

<p>Whether you prefer the delicate taste of green tea, the robust flavor of black tea, or the fruity infusion of fruit tea, there's a tea for everyone to enjoy!</p>
